    5:AM has set out to become the creative powerhouse of the 21st century. We
    are convinced that by creating a decentralized platform & community for
    creatives of all kinds to come together to work on the projects that will
    power the future of web3, we can bring out the maximum creativity in all of
    us
    <br /><br />
    Our vision is to build this into a genre and borders-defying creativity engine.
    We are a cohort of the best architects, best motion designers, NFT artists, movie
    directors and other creative spirits, all working together to design how we interact
    with content and each other, both virtually and physically.
    <br /><br />
    <strong
      >In its first iteration, 5:AM will focus on projects in the context of
      graphic, web, and product design.</strong
    > We will use this vertical as a testing ground to develop the methodologies
    that are most supportive of creative collaboration in a decentralized fashion.
